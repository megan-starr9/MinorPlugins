# Minor Plugins for MYBB

## TaggedDeletion
A Mybb Plugin designed to work with forum tagging systems

Many tagging systems on Mybb work through PM notifications.  These pms can quickly build up and fill up user's inboxes!

This is where my plugin comes in.  It provides a button on the pm interface that allows users to send all PM Tag
notifications to their trash can.  The plugin has a single setting where an admin can enter the subject each of
these tag notifications has.  This is likely also a setting in the tagging system!  All pms with that subject 
will then be deleted when a user chooses.
