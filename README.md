# Minor Plugins for MYBB

## DisplayGroupFix
Makes it so that when a user requests to join a group and is accepted, or when a user is added to a group by a leader, their display group is automatically set to be the new group.

## UserTagging
An improvement on this plugin -> http://mods.mybb.com/view/user-tagging.  A very simple tagging plugin to allow users to mention others in a post using @Name.  It is pretty highly optimized and notifies using the PM system.

## TaggedDeletion
Adds a button to a user's inbox that allows them to delete all tag notifications.  Admins need to set the tag PM subject within the plugin settings so that it knows which to delete.
