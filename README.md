# Minor Plugins for MYBB

## DisplayGroupFix
Makes it so that when a user requests to join a group and is accepted, or when a user is added to a group by a leader, their display group is automatically set to be the new group.

## UserTagging
An improvement on this plugin -> http://mods.mybb.com/view/user-tagging
A very simple tagging plugin to allow users to mention others in a post user @Name
It is pretty highly optimized and notifies using the PM system.

## TaggedDeletion
A Mybb Plugin designed to work with forum tagging systems

Many tagging systems on Mybb work through PM notifications.  These pms can quickly build up and fill up user's inboxes!

This is where my plugin comes in.  It provides a button on the pm interface that allows users to send all PM Tag
notifications to their trash can.  The plugin has a single setting where an admin can enter the subject each of
these tag notifications has.  This is likely also a setting in the tagging system!  All pms with that subject 
will then be deleted when a user chooses.
